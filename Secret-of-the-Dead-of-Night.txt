Secret of the Dead of Night

Never thought, nor seen by eye,
Divulge this secrets of a summer sky!

Light as a spell of the splendor of night,
Lightest thou the secret of that dead light?

She had as well a smile to be took,
Until that fair tower he might not look!

Your smile was as the moon in the night,
Across my country I perceived the light!

Inspired by Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allan Poe
