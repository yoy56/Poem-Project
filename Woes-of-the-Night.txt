Woes of the Night

When I went down the steps, frightened inside.
A music that came in an instant tide.

Amid too could they forget our woe,
Before thy moon shall leave a world of wo!

Spring of my youth had been a summer nightâ€”
Across the sunrise I perceived the light!

Slowly as the dawn will come past thee night,
Across my country I perceived the light!
