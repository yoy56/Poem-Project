Winter Poem

Within the winter's cold blue sky,
Never I said so much about the ice,
Amid these soft and pensive nests of spice,
Set like a token in thy gentle eye!

Wild was my heavy hair to try away
Close here I flung thee on the quiet eve,
Bright as a star, his daisies might perceive.
It keeps our sitting in a public way.

Inspired by Emily Dickinson, Edgar Allan Poe, and Robert Frost

COMPOSED IN VERSE BY VERSE

Note: I like the addition of Robert Frost, but this is the poem I spent the least time on. Also, Grammarly fixed some on this poem.
